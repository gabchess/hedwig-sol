# Hedwig Architecture

Hedwig is an onchain authorization primitive organized around three domain
nouns—orgs, roles, and members—and six domain actions. The repository keeps the
conventional Anchor shell while making the authorization model visible in file
and symbol names.

## Domain boundary

Hedwig answers one question: does this pubkey currently hold this role?

| Domain term     | Onchain meaning                                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Org`           | Namespace owned by one authority pubkey                    |
| `Role`          | Named authority under an org, controlled by its role admin |
| `Member`        | Account proving one holder pubkey belongs to one role      |
| Holder          | Pubkey named by a member account; not necessarily a signer |
| Circuit breaker | Role-wide enabled flag managed through `set_role_enabled`  |
| Role check      | CPI-friendly validation through `check_role`               |

Hedwig does not define what a role authorizes inside another program. It does not
authenticate the actor presented by that program, create delegation chains, or
evaluate token- or vote-based eligibility. Those policies belong to the consumer
or to wrapper programs.

## Account graph

```text
authority
  └─ Org ["org", authority]
       └─ Role ["role", org, role_name]
            └─ Member ["member", role, holder]
```

- One authority currently derives one org.
- A role name is part of its PDA seed and cannot be renamed.
- A role admin is initialized to the org authority. The current core has no
  instruction to transfer that admin field.
- A member may expire at a Unix timestamp; `0` means no expiry.
- Revocation closes the member PDA and decrements the role's member count.
- Disabling a role preserves members but blocks checks and new assignments.

Program ownership, Anchor account deserialization, PDA seed and bump checks, and
explicit `has_one` constraints enforce relationships between these accounts.
Discriminators identify account types; they do not establish account identity on
their own.

## Instruction flow

```text
create_org
    └─ create_role
         ├─ assign_role ── check_role
         ├─ revoke_role
         └─ set_role_enabled
```

The mutating instructions authenticate the relevant authority or role admin.
`check_role` is intentionally read-only and requires no holder signature. Its
account constraints bind `Member.role` to the supplied role and `Member.holder`
to the supplied holder; its handler then rejects disabled roles and elapsed
memberships.

For CPI use, the consuming program must first authenticate the actor it maps to
`holder`. A wallet consumer can require a signer. A program identity can use its
own PDA validation. The consumer then invokes `check_role` and propagates its
`Result`; propagating an error aborts the consuming instruction.

The repository's reference consumer demonstrates the signer pattern. Its
counter PDA and stored authority are bound to the signer, the signer is passed
as Hedwig's holder, and `Program<HedwigSol>` pins the CPI target. The consumer
is a separate live devnet program and reference integration, not a new Hedwig
domain layer or evidence of independent adoption.

Integration risks, especially holder authentication and upgrade authority,
belong in [THREAT-MODEL.md](../THREAT-MODEL.md), not in this code map.
