# Contributing to Hedwig

Hedwig is a small Solana-native roles primitive. Keep changes narrow, auditable, and honest about what is built versus planned.

## Local checks

Run the full local release checks before opening a PR:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo build
cargo build-sbf --manifest-path programs/hedwig_consumer/Cargo.toml
cargo build-sbf --manifest-path programs/hedwig_sol/Cargo.toml
cargo test --workspace
yarn sdk:typecheck
yarn sdk:test
yarn sdk:build
./node_modules/.bin/tsc -p app/tsconfig.json --noEmit
```

The tests use LiteSVM and do not require a network connection. Build both SBF
artifacts before the workspace tests because the fixtures load them at compile
time. CI enforces the Rust, SBF, and app dependency-audit gates. The SDK and app
TypeScript checks remain required local gates until the repository's Yarn
install policy is resolved.

## Contribution rules

- Keep the core instruction set small: `create_org`, `create_role`, `assign_role`, `revoke_role`, `check_role`, and `set_role_enabled`.
- Do not add nested role hierarchies or agent-to-agent delegation to the core program. Build those patterns as wrapper programs.
- Do not treat `check_role` as identity authentication. A consuming program must authenticate the holder before trusting the role check.
- Preserve the conventional Anchor shell, but name domain code after Hedwig concepts and actions. Avoid generic `utils`, `manager`, or `service` layers.
- Add an abstraction only after a concrete integration demonstrates repeated need. Prefer deletion and direct code when both are equally safe.
- Keep unfinished work in docs or issues, not as TODO/FIXME stubs in source.
- Update README, roadmap, and threat-model claims together when a change affects shipped status, risks, or public guarantees.

## Pull request bar

A useful PR says what changed, why it matters, and which check proves it. If the change touches authorization, include at least one negative test for the failure path.
